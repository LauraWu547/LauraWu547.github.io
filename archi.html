                Interested in the ergonomics of ferrets, I conceived this residence for them, incorporating multiple curved surfaces and tunnels to meet their demands for rest and play. To substantiate the design, I constructed a model using the digital modeling software Rhino and printed it with a 3D printer.

                The final project is a ruined ancient garden where the only owner can rest, cook, cleanse, study, and contemplate. The initial form of my design came from one of the bas reliefs in the previous project. After completed the 6 section drawings of the bas relief manually, I redrew them in the digital modeling software Rhino and transformed them into a three-dimensional model through extrusion and rotation.<br>

                The theme “flipping” is stressed mainly through stairs and arches. The rotated stairs and arches enable the user to inhabit the garden no matter what direction it flips to.

            Concerning the underuse of leftover space in urban regions, abundant around commercial areas with the highest population density, our team was interested in transforming these spaces into places for rest and recreation. Using an underground space in the CBD center of Guangzhou as our study sample, our group proposed a renovation design for the space as the research outcome.

            During the National Trials and Global Qualification, our team respectively scored in the top 50% and 20% of teams.

                Low in density while high in strength and pliability, the special characteristics of this material lead to a great possibility of designs. To fully exploit the advantages of this material, our team designed a pure bamboo structure for recreation, which incorporates multiple curved surfaces and a woven covering layer to emphasize the distinctness of this material.
