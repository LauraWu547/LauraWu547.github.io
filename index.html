    <p><b>Hi, this is Laura Wu in high school,</b></p>
      <p>An innocent junior hesitating between fashion design and architecture but eventually decided to pursue the latter. Amazed by how architecture combines aesthetics and utility, I truly enjoyed the process of creating projects for my portfolio. 2019 is when I started my exploration in architecture, and here you will see the works of an immature yet passionate beginner architect during the first few years of her journey.</p>

    <div id="content2">
      <label>"From an early age, I have shown a great interest in the creation of beauty. Later, when I learned about the architectural designs related to ordinary people's lives... I realized that the meaning of design can be greater than beauty... As I beheld the undesirable living conditions in local historical residences, I became more determined to pursue an architecture profession, creating better living environments for the public."</label>
